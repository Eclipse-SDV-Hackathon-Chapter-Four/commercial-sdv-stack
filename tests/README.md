# Integration Tests — Authorization Guarantees

Reproducible integration tests that prove the Commercial SDV Stack enforces its
security model: **valid attested workloads succeed; unauthorized workloads, forbidden
operations, bad audiences, and expired or forged credentials all fail closed.**

Addresses [issue #8](https://github.com/Eclipse-SDV-Hackathon-Chapter-Four/OPHF-commercial-sdv-stack/issues/8).

## What is tested, and where

The stack has **two authorization enforcement points**. Both validate a JWT-SVID
against a required audience via the SPIRE Agent Workload API, then apply an
[Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) (Rego) rule:

| Enforcement point | Surface | Required audience | Rego decision | Allowed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sovd-cda` | HTTP `:20002` (SOVD/REST) | `sovd.cda` | `service_name ∈ allowed_services[spiffe_id]` | `…/vehicle/powertrain-mode-controller` → `Powertrain_Mode_Read`, `Powertrain_Mode_Write` |
| `powertrain-mode-controller` | uProtocol RPC (MQTT) | `powertrain.mode-control` | `method_id ∈ allowed_method_ids[spiffe_id]` | `…/backend/fms` → methods `1`, `2` |

**This suite drives the CDA HTTP enforcement point.** It is the ideal test surface: it
exercises *both* the audience check and the Rego check, it is plain HTTP + Bearer token,
and every scenario can be produced deterministically by minting JWT-SVIDs from the
running `spire-server`. The uProtocol path uses the identical Rego pattern and is covered
by the demo flow (see [Not yet automated](#not-yet-automated)).

### How the matrix is produced

Tests mint JWT-SVIDs with `spire-server jwt mint`, which lets us forge any
`spiffe_id` / `audience` / `ttl` combination on demand. Minting is an **admin** operation
that bypasses workload attestation — which is exactly right here: we are validating the
CDA's **token-validation and authorization** layers, not node/workload attestation.
Attestation is covered separately (see [Not yet automated](#not-yet-automated)).

This is a standalone Cargo crate at the **commercial-sdv-stack root** (`tests/`), next
to `docker-compose.yaml`. It is deliberately **not** a member of the `uservices`
workspace, so it never pulls in the musl/cross build — it just drives the running stack.
The crate shells out to `docker compose exec spire-server ...` to mint tokens and uses
`reqwest` to call the CDA. Override the stack location with `STACK_DIR=...` if needed.

## Prerequisites

```bash
# From the commercial-sdv-stack root:

# Build images and start infra + the powertrain use case
docker compose --profile infra --profile powertrain up -d --build

# Register the workloads with SPIRE
scripts/register_workloads.sh
```

Needs a Rust toolchain (`cargo`) plus a running `docker` daemon. The suite reaches the
CDA at `http://localhost:20002`.

## Running

```bash
cd tests
cargo test                  # runs the whole matrix; exit code non-zero on any failure
cargo test -- --nocapture   # see per-test detail
```

No local Rust toolchain? Use the wrapper — it compiles the test binary in a Rust
container and runs it on the host (where `docker` and `localhost:20002` are reachable):

```bash
./run.sh                    # whole matrix
./run.sh --skip expired     # skip the slow ~70s expiry check
```

`cargo test` output is the pass/fail report (one line per `#[test]`, summarised at the
end) — suitable for CI and presentation. `spire-server` must be running for the suite to
mint tokens; the CDA must be up for the HTTP checks to pass.

> **Note:** `expired_token_is_denied` sleeps ~70s (past SPIRE's clock-skew leeway, see
> below). Skip the slow path during quick iteration with
> `cargo test -- --skip expired`.

### Configuration

Override via environment variables (see `src/lib.rs`): `STACK_DIR`, `CDA_BASE`,
`CDA_PORT`, `TRUST_DOMAIN`, `SPIFFE_PMC`, `SPIFFE_PROPERTIES`, `SPIFFE_UNKNOWN`,
`AUD_CDA`, `AUD_WRONG`, `PWT_DATA_PATH`, `EXPIRY_WAIT_SECONDS`.

## Expected results

| # | Scenario | Credential presented | Expected |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Authorized read | `powertrain-mode-controller`, aud `sovd.cda` | **ALLOW** (2xx) |
| 2 | Authorized write | `powertrain-mode-controller`, aud `sovd.cda` | **ALLOW** (2xx) |
| 3 | Forbidden identity (not in allow-list) | `vehicle/properties` (no allow-list entry) | **DENY** (403) |
| 4 | Unknown SPIFFE ID (not in allow-list) | `vehicle/intruder` (not allow-listed) | **DENY** (403) |
| 5 | Wrong JWT audience | correct id, aud `wrong.audience` | **DENY** (403) |
| 6 | Expired JWT | correct id, `ttl 2s`, wait `>60s` (leeway) | **DENY** (403) |
| 7 | Missing token | *(no Authorization header)* | **DENY** (401) |
| 8 | Tampered signature | valid token, middle sig byte flipped | **DENY** (403) |
| 9 | `alg:none` forged token | unsigned algorithm-confusion token | **DENY** (403) |
| 10 | Multi-audience token | aud `[sovd.cda, other.service]` | **ALLOW** (2xx) — audience is *contains*, not *equals* |

The suite classifies any `2xx` as **ALLOW** and any `401`/`403` as **DENY** (a `2xx` on a
deny row is a security hole and fails; a `4xx` other than `401`/`403` — e.g. a `404` from a
wrong resource path — also fails, as does a `5xx`/unreachable). The code split is **not** a
clean authn-vs-authz boundary: the CDA maps *every* token failure — wrong audience, bad
signature, expired, `alg:none` — through one `InvalidToken` path returning **403**. Only a
**missing** token returns **401** (`NoTokenProvided`). The suite asserts `401` exactly for
the missing-token case (guarding authenticate-before-authorize) and accepts `401` or `403`
for the other deny rows.

**On the `401`-vs-`403` codes** (verified against the live stack): only a **missing** token
returns `401`. *Every* token-validation failure — wrong audience, bad/tampered signature,
expired, `alg:none` — is reported by the CDA as **`403`** (`"Invalid token: Token
validation failed"`), as is a Rego authorization denial (`"not authorized to invoke
service"`). So the code alone does not distinguish an authentication failure from an
authorization denial; both surface as `403`. See `cda/src/spiffe_security_plugin.rs`:
`NoTokenProvided` → `401`, while `InvalidToken` and the OPA `AccessDenied` path → `403`.

> **Resource resolution happens before the Rego check.** The CDA authenticates the token
> first, then resolves the requested diagnostic service, then runs OPA. A request for a
> **non-existent** resource path therefore returns `404` *before* authorization runs — even
> for a forbidden identity. The DENY rows above depend on `PWT_DATA_PATH` resolving to a
> real diagnostic service; a stale/wrong path would make those rows return `404` and the
> suite would **fail loudly** (`404 ∉ {401,403}`), not pass spuriously.

> **Rows 3 and 4 exercise the same enforcement branch.** Because tokens are admin-minted
> (attestation bypassed), the CDA cannot tell a *registered* identity (`vehicle/properties`,
> which has a real SPIRE entry) from an *unregistered* one (`vehicle/intruder`): neither
> appears in `allowed_services`, so both are denied by the identical OPA rule. These rows
> prove "any SPIFFE ID not on the allow-list is denied" — they do **not** prove the
> registered-vs-unregistered distinction. That distinction is a property of **attestation**
> and is covered by the `modified_image_gets_no_identity` stateful test below.

### Observed behaviours (verified against the live stack)

- **JWT validation enforces the signature.** A token with a single flipped byte in the
  signature is rejected (`error in cryptographic primitive`). *Note for test authors:* in a
  64-byte ES256 signature the **last** base64url character carries only 2 significant bits,
  so tampering it is often a no-op — flip a character in the middle (the suite does).
- **`exp` is enforced with a ~60-second clock-skew leeway.** SPIRE's JWT validation
  (go-jose) accepts a token for up to ~60s past its `exp`. A token expired by less than
  that is still accepted; beyond it the agent reports `token has expired` and the CDA
  returns 403. The expiry test therefore waits `EXPIRY_WAIT_SECONDS` (default 70s). This
  answers issue #8's "how long existing JWT-SVIDs remain usable" for the near-expiry edge:
  **exp + ~60s**.

## Demo sequence (presentation)

```bash
# From the commercial-sdv-stack root:
docker compose --profile infra --profile powertrain up -d --build   # bring the stack up
scripts/register_workloads.sh                                        # register workloads
( cd tests && cargo test )                                           # green matrix on screen
```

The `cargo test` summary is the money shot: one `#[test]` per guarantee, all green,
non-zero exit on any regression.

## Stateful tests (attestation & offline) — run deliberately

These scenarios from issue #8 mutate the running stack (launch a rogue container,
stop/start `spire-server`), so they live in `tests/offline.rs` and are `#[ignore]`d —
excluded from the default `cargo test`. A global lock serializes them and a Drop guard
always restarts `spire-server`, so a failure can't leave it stopped. Run with the stack
up:

```bash
cargo test --test offline -- --ignored --test-threads=1
# or:  ./run.sh --ignored --test-threads=1
```

| Test | Scenario | Expected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `modified_image_gets_no_identity` | Rogue container (unregistered Docker image) shares the vehicle agent socket and asks for a JWT-SVID | `PermissionDenied: no identity issued` — no SVID |
| `offline_cached_accepted_expired_rejected` | `spire-server` stopped; a pre-minted still-valid token vs. an expired one | cached valid → **ALLOW**; expired → **DENY** (fails securely) |

The attestation test proves SPIRE's dual selector (**Docker image id + `UP_LOCAL_ADDRESS`
env**, see `scripts/register_workloads.sh`): an image that isn't a registered selector
gets no identity. The offline test proves the agent validates cached credentials against
its cached JWT bundle while the backend is down, yet still rejects expired ones — and new
SVID issuance is impossible until the server returns.

**Characterization notes:**

- **JWT-SVID lifetime** — minted TTLs are capped by the server (observe the
  `JWT-SVID lifetime was capped…` notice); tokens are usable until their `exp` (plus the
  ~60s leeway above).
- **A `spire-server` *restart* does NOT invalidate existing tokens.** The JWT signing
  keys are managed by an in-memory `KeyManager`, but their public halves are persisted in
  the server's SQLite datastore (which survives a `docker compose restart`) and retained
  in the published bundle for the rotation-overlap window. Previously issued tokens
  therefore keep validating until their own `exp`. Only recreating the server
  (`down`/`up`, wiping the ephemeral datastore) rotates the trust material — verified: an
  old token was still accepted 60s after a restart.
